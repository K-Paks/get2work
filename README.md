# get2work
Because pandemics does not support productivity.

### Free yourself from procrastination!
Having trouble with working during these difficult times? Don't you worry, because I have the perfect solution for you! 
Let me present you **get2work** extension.

### How to install
1. Clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/K-Paks/get2work
```
2. Open up your Chrome extensions ( chrome://extensions/ ).
3. Click `load unpacked` and select your local respository's folder.

### How to use
By default the extension will block all the pages on the `facebook.com` and `youtube.com` domain, but you can add/remove any page you 
like by editing the `manifest.json` file and reloading the extension.

### How it works
Every time you try to go on the restricted pages, the extension will block any action you can possibly do on the page for 30 seconds, flash the **GET TO WORK** inscription in your face and play `audio.mp3`. The default sound is the Terence Fletcher from the movie Whiplash insulting you, but you can change it to whatever you'd like. Just make sure it is named `audio.mp3`.

##### Happy working everybody! Stay healthy!
